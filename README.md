I took the main template from LUX because there were things I couldn't do on my own when trying to resize the screen, which their css accomplished for me. I downloaded 2 of their css files to be able to edit some of the content, but my main work is in the home.css file and the html files. My index page directs to my article overview page, which directs to the article content page, where the full text for the Communist Manifesto can be found. I chose white and grey background to make it easier on the eyes.
